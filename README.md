# face-blur-opencv
In this small test project, I have created a simple face blur program using OpenCV. For this, we first utilize the object tracking algorithms available with OpenCV, 
viz. MeanShift and CAMShift. I then apply Gaussian blur on the face area detected by the algorithms and display the result, which is a live video feed from the webcam.![donepng](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63134916/193299192-689011ef-ce12-4fed-8198-04cdbbcf4693.png)
